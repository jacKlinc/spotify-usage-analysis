    "# Artist Prediction Model ðŸŽ¶\n",
    "\n",
    "This model attempts to predict a user's preferred artist based on their top 50 artists from Spotify. The information is limited, but hopefully something useful might come of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eric Boam's Analysis\n",
    "Eric collected data on music from Man, Machine and Media. Media being friends on social media; this saw the highest percentage of top ten albums (highest quality) while the Machine had a lower percentage but many more data points (highest quantity).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Release Radar playlist is released daily for each user. \n",
    "These are the general trends that Eric found:\n",
    "- Songs added at midnight\n",
    "- Keep song on list for max 4 weeks\n",
    "- Favour familiar artists\n",
    "- Use remixes when music runs thin\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### BaRT\n",
    "The AI system in charge of organising your Spotify homepage is called Bandits for Recommendations as Treatments (BaRT). It works on the balance between exploit and explore, the former recommendinf what the user already likes and the latter showing them new stuff.\n",
    "Important metrics:\n",
    "1. 30-Sec rule-ignore songs that get skipped \n",
    "2. Audio Analysis-idenitfy audio patterns to find more like it\n",
    "3. User age, location and gender-find what others like\n",
    "\n",
    "[More on this](https://analyticsindiamag.com/how-spotifys-algorithm-manages-to-find-your-inner-groove/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 30-Sec Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "This generally indicates that someone likes a song, listening to the end should further add to this. Continuously listening to a song over a period further indeicates appeal as it prevents the \"One Hit Wonder Issue\" which could skew recommendations with trending songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Artist/Song Follow-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user listens to a song, do they checkout the artist after? Are their next played songs from that artist/album? \n",
    "\n",
    "These are called \"high-quality actions\" where these actions give a very good indication of the user liking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation Models\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Layperson:\n",
    "        This finds other users who like the same stuff as you and recommends what you don't have\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Acoustic Analysis**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Spotify gives the high-level audio characteristics that describe how the song sounds. Some include \"danceability\" and \"tempo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sample JSON Response:\n",
    "    ``` json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"duration_ms\" : 255349,\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    The above fields are a lot easier to work with compared to raw audio data which is difficult to analyse and expensive to process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Natural Language Processing**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The \"Batch Audio Models\" and \"Batch NLP Models\" are little out of my depth and require a lot of processing to get done so Audio/Text Analysis of songs will be left out. The main focus will be:\n",
    "- Play Logs\n",
    "- Track metadata\n",
    "- Batch CF Models (Collabarative Filtering)"
